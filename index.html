<body>
    <p>MCSS is a pure CSS library for displaying and formatting mathematical  expressions.</p>
    <p>Though heavy on markup, it allows for proper and easy formatting of almost any mathematical expression, from a simple
        <span class="mcss mcss-inline">
            <span class="mcss-fraction">
                <span class="mcss-fraction-num">1</span>
                <span class="mcss-fraction-den">2</span>
            </span>
        </span>
        (vertically aligning within a p is still hard) to extremely complex expressions, such as
        <span class="mcss mcss-inline">
            <span class="mcss-fraction">
                <span class="mcss-fraction-num">1</span>
                <span class="mcss-fraction-den">2</span>
            </span>
            +
            <span class="mcss-fraction">
                <span class="mcss-fraction-num">1</span>
                <span class="mcss-fraction-den">
                    <span class="mcss-largeop">
                        <span class="mcss-largeop-config">

        . As far as I know, this expression is meaningless and probably not even possible to compute by hand, it's just an example. This p block is also intentionally made longer to show that it successfully wraps around the expression (Zoom in if it's still not long enough)

        is also a complex, but meaningless expression for the sake of demonstration.
